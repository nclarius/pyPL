    A Kripke structure of intuitionistic predicate logic.

    A ConstModalStructure is a quadrupel <K,R,D,I> with
      - K = set of states
      - R = the accessibility relation, a binary relation on K
      - D = an assignment of possible worlds to domains of discourse
      - I = interpretation function assigning to each member of K and each non-logical symbol a denotation
    and a set of assignment functions gs assigning to each statek to each variable an element from the domain of k.

    - The set of states K is a set of states, specified as strings, where the root state has to be specified as 'k0':
       K = {'k0', 'k1', 'k2' ...}

    - The accessibility relation R is a partial order on K,
      where only the primitive acessiblity pairs have to be specified and the reflexive and transitive closure
      is computed automatically:
       R = {('k0', 'k1'), ('k0', 'k2'), ...}

    - The domain D is a a dictionary with
      - states (specified as strings) as keys and
      - domains as values
        - The domain D_k is a set of individuals, specified as strings:
           {'a', 'b', 'c', ...}
       D = {'k0': {'a'}, 'k1': {'a', 'b'}, 'k2': {'a', 'c'}, ...}

    - The interpretation function F is a dictionary with
      - states as keys and
      - and an interpretation of the non-logical symbols as values

        - The interpretation function F_k is a dictionary with
          - non-logical symbols (specified as strings) as keys and
          - members/subsets/functions of D as values

           {'c': 'a', 'P': {('a', ), ('b', )}, 'f': {('c1',): 'a', ('c2',): 'b'}}

            - The denotation of individual constants is a member (string) of D:
               'c': 'a'

            - The denotation of predicates is a set of tuples of members (strings) of D:
               'P': {('a', ), ('b', )}
               'R': {('a', 'b'), ('b', 'c')}

              - Note that the denotation of 1-place predicates (set of individuals) has to be specified as
                 'P': {('a', ), ('b', ), ('c', )}
                rather than
                 'P': {('a'), ('b'), ('c')}
                 or
                 'P': {'a','b','c'}

              - The denotation of 0-place predicates has to be specified as a set of 0-tuples:
                 'Q': {()}      iff the proposition expressed by 'Q' is true
                 'Q': {}        iff the proposition expressed by 'Q' false

            - The denotation of function symbols is a dictionary with
              - tuples of members of D as keys and
              - members of D as values
               'f': {('c1',): 'a', ('c2',): 'b'}
               'h': {('c1', 'c2'): 'a'}

         I = {'k0':  {'c': 'a', 'P': {('a', )}}, 'k0': {'c': 'a',  'P': {('a', ), ('b', )}}}
